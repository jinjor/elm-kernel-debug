elm-kernel-debug
====

Compile kernel code and test it.

## Note

After running `build.sh`, check the `0.19.0/package` folder for your module. If you see multiple versions of it in there, your changes may not be built into `index.html`! In that case, adjust the version of your module in its `elm.json` to match the one the Elm compiler brings in.
